                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">ChannelMeter is a video analytics startup that was part of 500 Startups Batch 9.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="contents/img/portfolio/channelmeter/header-image.jpg" alt="">
                            <p class="text-caption">Redesign of ChannelMeter's homepage.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>As a UI design intern at <a href="http://channelmeter.com" target="_blank">ChannelMeter</a> this past summer, I was responsible for their complete redesign effort – frontend website, internal systems, blog, social media, and pitch deck for 500 Startups' Demo Day. 
                            <br>
                            Since I was the only designer on the team, I was able to touch almost every part of the product and have my designs shipped out everyday. The goal of the redesign was to give ChannelMeter a complete transformation in branding – I wanted to refresh their image as a simpler, more effective analytics tool. To provide a better sense of my design process, below is a brief walkthrough of how I went about redesigning the homepage. 
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="contents/img/portfolio/channelmeter/homepage-original.png" alt="">
                            <p class="text-caption">ChannelMeter's original homepage.</p>
                            <br>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="contents/img/portfolio/channelmeter/homepage-sketch.png" alt="">
                            <p class="text-caption">Before moving into any digital prototyping, I sketch out some quick mockups with pen and paper. This was a great way to share my initial thoughts with the engineering team and also measure the feasibility of each design with our limited resources.</p>
                            <br>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="contents/img/portfolio/channelmeter/homepage-prelim.png" alt="">
                            <p class="text-caption">First run-through, just cleaning up the homepage. ChannelMeter wanted their redesign to be simpler and more crisp than their original site was.</p>
                            <br>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="contents/img/portfolio/channelmeter/homepage-out-one.jpg" alt="">
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="contents/img/portfolio/channelmeter/homepage-out-two.jpg" alt="">
                            <p class="text-caption">I also experimented with several different ideas – one of them was adding a sidebar that would scroll outwards when hovered over.</p>
                            <br>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="contents/img/portfolio/channelmeter/homepage-final.png" alt="">
                            <p class="text-caption">The final redesign of the homepage: If the user has a specific video or channel in mind, they can enter their query into the search bar and immediately see some of the key analytics behind the content. 
                            <br>
                            However, for users who are simply browsing the site and do not have anything particular in mind, they can jump into one of the colorful squares around the search bar – these represent the icons of a variety of popular channels, from sports channels to fashion channels.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>And below are a few quick before-and-afters of other pages:</p>
                            <br>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="contents/img/portfolio/channelmeter/rankings-original.png" alt="">
                            <p class="text-caption">Original view of ChannelMeter's rankings page. Some points of confusion for users included the difficulty of comparing neighboring channels and the ability to pick certain topics to view – such as the top 100 videos of all-time versus the current month. Another source of uncertainty arose because the top five channels listed had 0 views because they were YouTube collections, not content creators.</p>
                            <br>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="contents/img/portfolio/channelmeter/rankings-final.png" alt="">
                            <p class="text-caption">Redesign of the rankings page – because ChannelMeter is, at its core, an analytics company, I knew we needed to place a much bigger focus on the numbers. The original view did not afford users the ability to easily compare the stats behind two channels or videos, so I cut down the extraneous visual patterning and emphasized the fundamental data. We also decided to add a sidebar that would give our users more options for topics they wanted to browse at a glance.</p>

                            <p class="text-caption">After view of ChannelMeter's onboarding process. My goal here was to clean up the interface and add a visual cue through the three-step sidebar so the user knows that the process of connecting his or her YouTube account to ChannelMeter is going to be quick and simple.</p>

                            <p class="text-caption">Before view of ChannelMeter's internal dashboard, which clients saw when they logged into their accounts. A big problem here was the navigation – there were no straightforward indicators of which level of data the user was viewing, and the hierarchy of information was unclear.</p>

                            <p class="text-caption">Because the internal systems were a bit more complex to redesign, I sat down with the engineering team and went through, point by point, which features we wanted to keep, which features to group together to simplify, and which to cut out to create a better final user experience. We often sketched out our ideas on whiteboards before creating anything in digital form.</p>

                            <p class="text-caption">Final redesign of ChannelMeter's internal dashboard – after talking with community managers and users during client meetings, I wanted to place a larger focus on the key stats that users most want to see when they first log in. Also included on the new dashboard are the most-viewed videos for the user's channel, sorted by week, month, or all time, as well as a feed feature that gives an at-a-glance summary of the most recent and important channel updates and analytics.</p>
                            <br>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="contents/img/portfolio/channelmeter/dashboard-details-final.png" alt="">
                            <p class="text-caption">We also added a few new features that users were looking for – for example, this channel details-by-day modal. In the world of YouTube, videos don't just grow more popular over weeks or months; viral overnight sensations are commonplace. To give our clients more insights into how their videos were performing on a short-term basis, we decided to add a daily breakdown option that popped up whenever a specific date was clicked within the dashboard.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>To complete the redesign effort, I also did some work for ChannelMeter's blog and social media branding.</p>
                            <br>

                            <p class="text-caption">The blog redesign – I wanted to tie the branding back to the visual design of the new website. We also threw in a shout-out to San Francisco, where ChannelMeter is located.</p>

                            <p>I've been a huge TED Talks enthusiast for many, many years – some of my favorite talks include Malcolm Gladwell's "Choice, happiness, and spaghetti sauce" and Jack Andraka's "A promising test for pancreatic cancer... from a teenager."
                            <br>
                            To put some of the things I've learned from TED Talks into visual language, I decided to create a poster series illustrating quotes from various talks. Below I've shown part of my process, from ideation and sketching to the final products, created mostly with Adobe Photoshop.</p>
